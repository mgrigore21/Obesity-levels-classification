# Obesity Levels Classification

This project aims to classify obesity levels based on various features using different machine learning models. The project is implemented in Python and uses the Scikit-learn library for model training and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files:

- `ml.py`: This file contains the main classification pipeline, which includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- `EDA.py`: This file contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) code, which includes functions for reading the data, calculating NaN values, printing most frequent values, and plotting feature distributions and correlation heatmaps.

- `tests.py`: This file contains unit tests for the `ClassificationPipeline` class in `ml.py`.

## How to Run

To run the main classification pipeline, execute the following command:

```bash
python ml.py
```
To run the exploratory data analysis code, execute the following command:

```bash 
python EDA.py
```
To run the unit tests, execute the following command:

```bash
python tests.py
```

Dependencies can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
